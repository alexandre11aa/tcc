\noindent 

Comprehend the behavior of intense rainfall in a region through the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency equation is an important step in the development of projects and studies that involve the analysis and control of pluviometric waters. The calculations that lead to the equation mentioned involve the grasp of the relationship between intensity, duration and frequency, as well as calculations that go through treatment of historical data series, optimization methods, probabilistic distributions, and statistical tests of adherence, trend and accuracy. Due to the complexity that exists in the understanding and determination of these equations, corresponding to the extensive probabilistic calculations and analyses, the present work proposed to develop a computational tool with an open source graphical interface. It enables engineers and scholars who require rainfall intensity to calculate the equation for chosen regions using their own datasets, or to study the algorithms and theoretical foundations that drive the entire calculation process.
